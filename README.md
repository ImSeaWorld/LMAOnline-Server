# LMAOnline

LMAOnline was the name of my Xbox 360 Jtag/RGH server.

The included sources:
  - LMAOnline Auth Panel (Didn't work well. Swapped to web panel after)
  - LMAOnline Tokens (Same thing as the auth panel. Both were a bad idea)
  - LMAOnline v3 (Close enough to the original)
  - LMAOnline v4.1 (Gross layout, not too much of a change)
  - LMAOnline v4.2 (Better layout, but it's not finished)

Modified over the years I never was able to make it perfect. 
Maybe someone will be able to find this useful.
